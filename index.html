										<p>I will begin this report by introducing the team members. My group was established with members: Anh Quang, Huynh Khang, Trung Kien, Thien Minh. After some discussion, we decided to name the group White. Below are the individual profiles of each team member.</p>
										<h2>Quang and Khang:</h2>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Khang.png" alt="" /></a>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Quang5.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>For Khang, he is a good, responsible classmate and always helps his team members. Compare the survey results of my Big-five Personality Test and Khang, we also have good interactions with the surroundings, and the ability to communicate and collaborate with team members. However, Khang is better than me in terms of creativity such as content creation and design. During the work, Khang may assist the team in modifying the group's website.</p>
										<h2>Quang and Kien:</h2>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/QuangMB.png" alt="" /></a>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/KienMB.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>For Kien, based on the survey, Kien is a sociable, not angry person who always resolves conflicts in the group. He always stays calm when analyzing one aspect of a problem, reasoning carefully and coming up with the best solution. With that prudence, it will help synthesize the opinions of members and come up with suitable plans to avoid conflicts occurring.</p>
										<h2>Quang and Minh:</h2>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/Quang5.png" alt="" /></a>
										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/MinhMB5.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Minh is the most responsible member of the group. Through the survey, we have opposing personalities. I am a leader, always seeing the strengths and weaknesses of each member as well as dividing exercises appropriately for each person's abilities. However, Minh is very fluent in IT, which will help the team solve IT and computer related issues. In general, assigning him the right task will improve the quality of the exercise.</p>
										<h2>Notion</h2>
										<p>In my perspective, the ability of a team is not determined by the number of excellent members in the team, but performance is what determines the success. The following important things when working in groups. The first is the cooperation of the members. Need to respect and listen to the opinions of others to see good and bad points, discuss together, and contribute to get effective working results. The second is the rational and fair assignment of work. Divide workload evenly among members and ensure the work is completed on schedule. The third is to respect and help each other. Working in groups, all members must know to help and respect each other, if your teammates have difficulty, please be willing to share and help, this will create a bond between the members. And finally, always on time. Always be on time, it will save other team members from waiting for you or spending more time repeating what was discussed earlier.

											In summary, those conditions will help our team to complete the project perfectly; And after the comparison between me and the team members, I realized the strengths and weaknesses of the members, thereby dividing the tasks in the most appropriate way.

									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>The Discord chat platform and RMIT website will be the core of this project. This will be a FAQ or Chat Bot with the Speech Recognition feature to allow a user to request RMIT information through a voice channel and to produce a response using an online API to parse/interpret natural language returned either as a visual or or verbal chat response. While there are a wide variety of uses for this technology, the primary focus of this project will be for visually impaired people who have issues understanding the content in the RMIT and RMIT.edu websites. As it stands, most of the information is displayed as text and videos are difficult to decipher from the dialogue. This project aims to create an interactive medium to provide some of the functionality found in a mobile application while providing accessibility and use with words for the visually impaired. The project is targeted mostly to visually disabled participants and, if they so wish, will be accessed by anyone.</p>
									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>Delivering audio content is a major problem when it comes to accessibility. It’s hard to understand what someone is trying to say when the audio just sounds like noise and very few platforms provide that with the audio in a format that’s suitable for people with hearing or visual disabilities. This project would be fascinating, as developers/students would be introduced to the processing of artificial intelligence/natural language as well as to programming to help improve skills for potential projects and/or careers. This project is believed to be significantly beneficial, as visually disabled adults could ask questions orally and have an audio format returned to them. I already have familiarity with Discord chat bots and the means to host these bots, which is very open and affordable either by cloud hosts such as Digital Ocean, Amazon Web services or a single-board machine such as a Raspberry Pi.</p>
									<h3>Description</h3>
									<p>The project will be managed on the Discord chat platform through the Discord Developer API and any APIs for natural language processing, like wit.ai or api.ai. Across Node.JS, Python, Java, NET / C++ and more the bot can run in the required language in the Discord Bot Library chosen for use.  The other key focus of the Bot Library is that it integrates with many bot frameworks in order to facilitate the building of bots. One of the major issues facing bot makers today is trying to curate and make sense of all the chatbots that are out there. Being able to build bots that are native to Discord is going to greatly increase developer flexibility. In addition, the Bot would be hosted on either Linux device, on a Digital Ocean or Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Server or on the single-board machine such as a Raspberry Pi and other related items.
										The bot will use a Voice Channel on the Discord platform and wait either always on or on the use of a trigger word for verbal user input. When verbal user feedback is obtained, the query is forwarded to the natural language processor API. The web scraper aims to collect the information directly from RMIT's website by retrieval of the corresponding information, which will be converted to the bot back into a text to the speech generator delivering a hearing response, by transmitting one of two units, one a web scraper and one FAQ. Otherwise the chat bot will respond to the user using the data stored for a particular entry, using the same text for the speech answer mechanisms as the web-scraping process, when the query fits the question stored in the FAQ module. The bot will also return different responses to questions which require more processing time such as when passing a question from the FAQ module to the web-scraper. This is a work in progress, and a limitation will be that a user’s question will not be logged unless they engage in an actual conversation with the bot. But the bot will have an option to store, print and create a digital profile upon interaction. Although the limitations to this project are the difficulty with the audio stream that is already being transmitted to the bot and the likelihood of multiple audio streams interacting with it when the bot is already used in more than one place/server).). There is also a substantial investment time required to set up the natural language processor to translate precisely what is the user demand and thus to have the right information. In contrast, a traditional bot which is simply programmed to understand a set of keywords and automatically respond by providing the information requested is much faster and is capable of being used on any device (with the exception of small Android screens, which require way too many taps). The above details would be of interest to any developer that is developing a bot capable of conversing with people. Chat platforms like Discord.net are always looking for new ways to improve their system. At present, Discord.net is the only platform to have provided integrated, real-time bot integrations with several vendors such as Google Home and Amazon Echo devices. 
										</p>
									<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
									<p>Any Linux computer, such as a Raspberry-Pi or other similar devices, will be needed for this project hardware. Or a virtual private server ( VPS) from a vendor that enables a developer to operate remotely such as Digital Ocean. Amazon's Web Services. Software includes the use of the API for natural language processing, such as wit.ai, api.ai and a similar discord bot library and language, such as Discord.JS (node.js), JDA (Java), Discord.NET (.NET Core) (Python). Ffmpeg, which would allow a bot to receive audio from the chat platform, would also be other resources needed.</p>
									<h3>Skills Required</h3>
									<p>This project requires several skills as below:
										● Linux system experience
										● Programing familiarity of Disk Bot Libraries in particular
										● API working experience
										● Experience with functions associated with ffmpeg/audio
										● Familiarity with website manipulation to collect data via API calls or web scraping.
										Any software that needs to be written in the language in question will be picked from the bot repository. Such hardware is not needed since it is necessary to use either a Digital Ocean server or the Web Services Amazon Server, but it can also be used with a Raspberry Pi or with some other related device on Linux. The probability to find the required software and hardware is very strong since it is open source software while the hardware, be it a VPS, or a Raspberry Pi, is easily accessible. As regard to skills however the software is the more relevant – although in practice, if the components are already known or the requirement is to find a particular piece of software then such as task would be possible. The full source code for Python Bot using the Node.js framework is also available, although to use this programming language one would need to know Python at least somewhat.
										</p>
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p>If this project succeeds, it results in a working chatbot, which could verbally or visually acknowledge the user's feedback and deliver the required response to the user. It will encourage visually disabled users who simply don't want to open a web browser to access data from the RMIT website easily and conveniently from inside the Discord chat app. Furthermore this project may also be built to avoid the use of a chat network and to be implemented separately in a kiosk, for instance.</p>
									<h3>Khang Feedback:</h3>
									<p>The project is a great idea and has a real practical application for visually impared RMIT students in particular. Furthermore, paying attention to such details as serving everyone from the normal to disadvantaged people equally was always something that RMIT is known for. However, I feel that a speech-to-text FAQ bot might be a little too difficult to build. speech - to - text technology to this point is still faulty even for big companies like apple, google, samsung with some of the best engineers in the world. The word input is just not correct many of the time. Furthermore, as a bot,  it will require an AI unit to interpret the text because the input is from mouth sentences from the user and that is much harder to process than selecting predetermined words like regular text based FAQ bot. Since AI is still in development it might be hard to successfully implement, not to mention the financial aspect of the project. </p>
									<h3>Discuss Feedback</h3>
									<p>Khang's feedback is very helpful in improving this chatbot idea. He pointed out the difficult points when this idea is applied in practice. At first, Khang said: "the project not only serves the visually impaired students at RMIT but also all other hearing impaired people". That contributes to the motivation for me to continue to research and develop this chatbot system, technologies born to make life easier for the visually impaired is always something that RMIT is always proud of. Second, the AI system may not be smart enough to convert text into speech most accurately, thus causing confusion. Through these two contributions, I completely agree with Khang. Application created to improve the difficulties of the visually impaired. I only thought of using it in school and forgot about many other visually impaired people. The AI system is not smart enough, it can cause the information provided to be misleading, thereby helping me to think of other solutions to improve it. Through this feedback, I realize that the project still has many points to implement such as object, practicality and cost. But in general, if the project is expanded, it will help the visually impaired have a better learning environment.</p>

									<h5>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h5>
									<p>INSULA: "The Insula Group is an organization in Australia that provides a wide variety of IT services and leading tech products in the industry. Matthew Furlong states “our company (INSULA) produces applications for a wide variety of industries. It has different positions, ranging from developers that cut code and improve the product, contractors who sell the software to other businesses, and developers that use it. "What we are doing is to make our solutions more effective and better for you." We manage Microsoft SQL large-scale databases that allow us to provide data schemes and applications from SQL" Jodi Dayan-Hill, Managing Director at INSULA I will be responsible for insulating the budget on top of raising and managing cash flow in the business.” “I am also responsible for quality, support and compliance. Our business has requirements for maintaining a secure database, but in order to do so, we must have the highest level of security. I will be responsible for all aspects of protecting our customers' data.” Matthew Furlong, Managing Director of INSULA. “Running a business successfully is all about having the right people and planning ahead to overcome obstacles. I will be responsible for bringing on board professionals with the right experience to deliver innovative solutions to our business and the needs of our clients.”</p>
									<h5>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h5>
									<p>'Everything from IT experts, consumers and investors and all our employees, programme developer working in all fields from database design to PHP web creation and numerous other languages to Microsoft Du Jour and cloud appliances, so that they are cutting code into other applications. Our other experts, we include IT-based project managers, organization consultants, distribution and marketing consultants. Our core value is certainly the service we offer. We focus on delivering excellence as a service, rather than just filling in a specialist niche. Our goal is to solve your challenges and give you the greatest return on your investment by using the right solutions. Our staff is always trained and focused on your success ". Given its technology focus, it’s no surprise that technology is a key focus for the company. This is where they place a particular emphasis on staying on the cutting edge.</p>
									<h5>Do you deal with investors or clients personally?</h5>
									<p>"I'm an account manager for about 40 separate customers, so my job is to make sure they're aware of what our tech deals are and what our service can do for them. My job is to go through the market experiments to try to learn how their organization works and how we are to convert their business activities into our software and to translate how we are going to use our software on the basis of what they are doing and/or changing them to enhance or improve what they are doing. When we get our applications in, I have to educate all end users and then, after the technologies have been applied, our support department will support the future. All of that requires a huge amount of management skills and your support staff, who will make sure everything is running in a smooth way, and managing the relationships and input of what our software can do and then building a very close working relationship with all our reseller partners and getting them to do the same. There is a lot to do. All this data entry and stuff, and then you add in all the administration of all the different staff roles and that is all wrapped up in this software”</p>
									<h5>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h5>
									<p>"Most of my time is focused on the applications bought by our current customers and/or potential customers. For our current users, they consider their needs, ensure they make the best of the app, introduce new capabilities, new functionality, new processes for existing companies, evaluate how we can integrate, customize and improve their processes into our applications. I can explain to our developers what needs to be done with our software to enable them to use it in the way they want, if we have to do development in our software." 'For potential users, we must create new content, and new features in the product to make it effective to use it, based on the degree that we call gap analytics (to identify whether there is a gap between what they do now and what their software does).'</p>
									<h5>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h5>
									<p>"We deal with so many people who are different from the sales consultants, draftsmen, engineers, executives, accountants, building supervisors who have a different background, aspirations, knowledge and know-how of companies. We deal with people on job sites, off on equipment, all the numerous company owners, all of these. Too many diverse people with different cultures, different perspectives, different aspirations and attitudes are not an easy feat to make everyone happy."</p>
